The objective of this project is to build a Single Ob- ject Recognition Machine Learning algorithm and compare its results with similar implementations in scikit-learn and Googleâ€™s TensorFlow. The algo- rithm is evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 data set. The dataset is split into test and train subset. The algorithm trains on the training subset while the val- idation is done with the test subset. There are vari- ous ways to approach this problem. We will discuss few of them and which one we used for our classi- fier.
